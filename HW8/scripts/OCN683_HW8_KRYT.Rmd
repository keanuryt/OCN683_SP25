## Question 1 

```{r}
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility

# Initial conditions
trmt_avg <- 460
control_avg <- 415
sd_exp <- 110
nsims <- 1000

```

_1. Start by assuming three replicates each of the treatment and control plots._ 
_2. Perform 1000 simulations, where each time you draw three treatment ANPP values and three control ANPP values, using the appropriate means and standard deviation, from a normal distribution._

_3. For each random draw, fit a linear model testing for a treatment effect. Save the p-value from an F-test for the treatment effect (you can extract this with Anova(model)$P[1])._
_4. Also save the model coefficient that quantifies the difference between the treatment and control groups. At the end you should have 1000 p-values and 1000 coefficient values._
_5. What proportion of the p-values are less than 0.05? This is your statistical power, under this design, effect size, and residual noise._
_6. Now repeat this whole process using different numbers of replicates: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100._
_7. Plot the statistical power vs. the number of replicates._
_8. How much replication do you need to achieve a power of 0.25? This means that when there is a real treatment effect, you will detect it (only) 25% of the time._

```{r}
p_values <- numeric(nsims)  # Store p-values
coefficients <- numeric(nsims)  # Store treatment effect estimates

### Answer Q1

You need at least 21 replicates to get 25% statistical power. 


## Question 2

```{r}
#create empty tibble to save future mean coefficients
coef_df <- tibble(
  rep = numeric(),
  coef = numeric()
)

# list of the replicates 
replicates <- c(3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100)
```

```{r}
## Somehow my coefficients have negative values. I'm not sure if that's correct. However, due to later questions, I use the absolute value of the coefficients for my answers in the hw. 

# for loop to automate the calculation of the coefficients so I dont have to do it by hand like in Q1

for (i in 1:length(replicates)){
  rep <- replicates[i]
  experiment(rep = rep) # run the function that does the simulations
  coef <- mean(coefficients[p_values<0.05])
  
  tib <- tibble(rep=rep, coef=coef)
  coef_df <- bind_rows(coef_df, tib)
}

# print coef data frame
coef_df

```


```{r}
#calcultating the magnitude difference of the generated mean coefficients.

coef_df<- coef_df %>% 
  mutate(magnitude_difference = coef+46)
```


```{r}
(ggplot(coef_df, aes(x = rep, y = coef*-1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Coefficients vs. Number of Replicates",
    x = "Number of Replicates",
    y = "Coef") +
  theme_bw()) +
(ggplot(coef_df, aes(x = rep, y = magnitude_difference*-1)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Coefficients vs. Coef diff",
    x = "Number of Replicates",
    y = "Coef Diff") +
  theme_bw())
  
```



### Answer Q2

_How does the mean of the significant coefficients change as the number of replicates increases? Recall that because this is a simulation, we know the true value of the treatment difference: itâ€™s 461 - 415 = 46._
_How much larger is the simulated value from the significant experiments, compared to the true value? This is the type M error._
_What are the potential implications for our understanding of climate change, if most warming experiments have low power?_


- The mean of the significant coefficients gets closer to 0 as the number of replicates increases.
- If climate models have low power, then that would mean that the models produce inflated values in their results. Warming temperatures may be lower than expected my the models
